"""
    1. Encoder-only models (like BERT): These models use a bidirectional approach to understand context from both directions. Theyâ€™re best suited for tasks that require deep understanding of text, such as classification, named entity recognition, and question answering.

    2. Decoder-only models (like GPT, Llama): These models process text from left to right and are particularly good at text generation tasks. They can complete sentences, write essays, or even generate code based on a prompt.

    3. Encoder-decoder models (like T5, BART): These models combine both approaches, using an encoder to understand the input and a decoder to generate output. They excel at sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering.
